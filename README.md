# SamToken Contract

## Introduction
`SamToken` is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity for creating a custom ERC-20-like token. This contract allows for the minting (creation) and burning (destruction) of tokens. Key features include setting an initial total supply of tokens and tracking token balances for Ethereum addresses.

## Features
- Token name and abbreviation setting.
- Initial total supply configuration.
- Minting functionality to increase the token supply.
- Burning functionality to decrease the token supply.
- Balance tracking for each Ethereum address.

## Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.18
- Ethereum wallet with ETH for deployment
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for deployment and interaction

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/samtoken.git
   cd samtoken
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if using Truffle)
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment**
   Create a `.env` file and set up your Ethereum wallet and Infura API key (if deploying to a testnet or mainnet using Truffle).

## Deployment
- **Using Remix IDE**:
  1. Copy the `SamToken.sol` file content.
  2. Paste it into a new file in Remix IDE.
  3. Compile and deploy to your chosen network (Ropsten, Rinkeby, Mainnet, etc.).

- **Using Truffle**:
  1. Write a migration script in the `migrations` folder.
  2. Run `truffle deploy --network [network_name]`.

## Usage
After deployment, the contract allows for the following interactions:
- **Mint Tokens**: Increase the total supply and balance of a specific address.
- **Burn Tokens**: Decrease the total supply and balance of a specific address.

## Security Considerations
- This contract does not include access control mechanisms. As such, any user can mint new tokens.
- It's recommended to implement ownership and access control for the minting and burning functions in a production environment.
